    "You are creating a simple ecosystem containing three types of populations (you can imagine these to be animals, bacteria or something similar) on the computer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In your environment, there are three different animals: \"Rock Animals\", \"Paper Animals\" and \"Scissors Animals\".** ==> You will create a generic `Animal` class and derived classes for each of the specific animals.\n",
    "2. **In our model, animals will not move from where they start.**\n",
    "3. **The animals reproduce.** ==> All derived objectcs will have a method of reproduce/duplicate/clone over a given period. Their offspring will appear in a neigboring spot.\n",
    "4. **Each animal has a certain energy level. If an animal reproduces, it will first lose 1 unit of energy and split into two: it will keep half of its energy for itself and give its offspring the other half.** ==> You will write a `reproduce` method that will find an empty neighboring spot in the world, creates a clone of itself (same animal type) and assigns it to that empty spot.\n",
    "5. **The environment has a boundary.** ==> No animals can exist outside of this boundary.\n",
    "6. **Animals will be able to consume each other in a cyclical way modeled after Rock-Paper-Scissors.** ==> You will write code that allows them to \"eat\" a certain kind of different animal only. \"Rock 'eats' (beats) scissors\", \"scissors beats paper\" and \"paper beats rock\".\n",
    "7. **Note here** your main tasks are creating a generic `Animal` object and an object for each animal type that derives from `Animal`. The code to verify the created classes and run simulations is already functioning. No need to modify them. You are encouraged to take a look of those code to ensure your objects will be compatible with them before you create the objects.\n"

    "    - You will use two more colors later on. You are free to choose three different colors, such as just red, green and blue, but there are other color palettes out there that might be more suitable for anyone who might be color blind. There are many resources on the internet on this, one example that might be useful is [this web page](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/). The color scale you choose will not be graded, of course.\n",
    "  - `get_kind_name(self)`: This method should return the name of the kind of animal. You can choose any name you like, but in this case something like `\"rock\"` might be a good idea.\n",
    "  - `can_eat(self, other_animal)`: This method should return a boolean value (`True` or `False`). Its argument `other_animal` will be another instance of a class derived from `Animal`. If the other animal is one that we can eat it should return `True`, otherwise it should return `False`. You might want to call `get_kind_name()` from this function and check the name of the other animal. If it is `\"scissors\"`, we can eat it, otherwise we cannot (\"rock beats scissors\").\n",
    "  - `clone(self)`: This method should return a *new* instance of the `Rock_Animal` class, initialized to half the energy the current we currently have. It should also reduce the current energy of the `Rock_Animal` itself by half. (Thus simulating \"splitting\" the animal into two pieces of the same kind with half the energy as the original one/providing half of its energy to its offspring.) [Note that it is not necesary to deal with the part where animals lose \"1 unit of energy\" before they reproduce in `clone()` itself as this will be taken care of later by the `reproduce()` function.]\n",
    "    - ==> So clone should reduce the current energy by half then create a **new** `Rock_Animal` and inititalize that new animal to the new, halved, energy level. This new `Rock_Animal` should then be returned by the `clone` function.\n",
    "  - (Note: We will deal with defining the `eat()` and `reproduce()` functions from the `Animal` class later on. These functions will be part of the `Animal` class, but you can ignore them for now. Specifically, they should not be part of your derived class.)"
