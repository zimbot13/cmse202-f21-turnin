    "The full model uses all 4 penguin features to predict the results and you likely found that the model is pretty accurate using all 4 features. But in some cases, we might have significantly more features (which means much more computational time!), and we might not need nearly the level of accuracy we can achieve with the full data set or we might not have enough computational resources to use **all** of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such situations, we might need to see how close we can get with fewer features. But instead of simply removing features, we will use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the features that contribute the most the model (through their accounted variance) and use those to build our SVC model. We did this to improve our classification with the \"faces\" dataset in the **Day 21 assignment**.\n",

    "Because the features in our dataset have very different relative values (i.e. `body_mass_g` is in the range 3000-5000, but `bill_depth_mm` is the range 10-20), the variation captured by the PCA will be skewed by these relative differences. As a result, it is good practice to **normalize** the features so that they have comparable values. Thankfully, `sklearn` has a useful function for doing this!\n",

    "&#9989; **Do This**: Run the following cell which uses a `sklearn` function to perform a \"Min-Max\" scaling to normalize the features. These new features are stored in the `features_norm` variable. Take a look at the output to get a sense for how the values change when they are normalized."
