    "2. Once you've initialized the repository on GitHub, **clone a copy of it onto JupyterHub or your computer**.\n",
    "3. Inside the `cmse202-f21-turnin` repository, create a new folder called `hw-01`.\n",
    "4. Move this notebook into that **new directory** in your repository then **add it and commit it to your repository**. **Important**: you'll want to make sure you **save and close** the notebook before you do this step and then re-open it once you've added it to your repository.\n",
    "5. Finally, to test that everything is working, `git push` the notebook file so that it shows up in your <font color=\"red\">**_private_**</font> GitHub repository on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Make sure you've added your Professor and your TA as collaborators to your new \"turnin\" respository with \"Read\" access so that they can see your assignment. **You should check the Slack channel _for your section of the course_ to get this information.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Double-check the following**: Make sure that the version of this notebook that you are working on is the same one that you just added to your repository! If you are working on a different copy of the noteobok, **none of your changes will be tracked**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"`cmse202-f21-turnin`\" repository inside the `hw-01` directory that you just created.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit.\n",
